"""
1. You should have at least four classes: the parent Animal class, and
then at least three child animal classes that inherit from Animal.
2. Each class should have a few attributes and at least one method
that models some behavior appropriate for a specific animal or all
animalsâ€”such as walking, running, eating, sleeping, and so on.
3. Keep it simple. Utilize inheritance. Make sure you output details
about the animals and their behaviors.
